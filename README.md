# Front-End-Web-Developer-NanoDegree
This is where I will house all code associated with this Nano Degree.  
During My creations I used websites for help such as-http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp
Google for sure and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5703552/css-center-text-horizontal-and-vertical-inside-a-div-block
to name a few.  I will be using sites such as these to finish all my work.
